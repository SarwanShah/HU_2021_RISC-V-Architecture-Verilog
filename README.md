# Implementing RISC-V Architecture in Verilog

This project was developed under the EE-371 Computer Architecture course at Habib University during Spring 2021. This project involves the implementation of a **RISC-V processor architecture** using **Verilog** hardware description language. The RISC-V architecture is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration.

## ðŸ›  Project Features

- **Processor Core Design**: Implementation of the RISC-V processor core in Verilog.
- **Modular Design**: Organized code structure for different components of the processor.
- **Simulation Support**: Testbenches for simulating and verifying processor functionality.
